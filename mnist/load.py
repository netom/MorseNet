    is needed (the default behaviour if the data is not in a shared
    variable) would lead to a large decrease in performance.

    # (``shared_y`` does exactly that). But during our computations
    # we need them as ints (we use labels as index, and if they are
    # floats it doesn't make sense) therefore instead of returning
